Interpolation of a data set by a Newton's divided differences interpolation polynomial.

Usage: Create a data set file with the data to interpolate and call the Interpolate 
procedure with the filename as argument. A polynomial is returned at the form:

X^N + X^(N-1) + ...  + X + c

and a accuracy test is done to verify the accuracy of the generated polynomial. The 
accuracy is defined in the range 0.0 .. 1.0.

Data set format:
---------------

The data set file contain two column one for the X values and one for the F(X) values:

 X  F(X)
1.0  1.0
2.0  4.0
3.0  9.0
4.0  16.0


Remember to end the data files with a blank line.
